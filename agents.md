1. Before making any kind of change to the system, first read the architecture.md file in the root of the project, and if the change conflicts with any of the archtictural decisions, then highlight to the user what the difference is and ask the user what to do next.

2. When a change is made, ensure that the docs/site documentation is updated, added, removed, modified for any of the changes.

3. The vscode-extension must always reflect all the latest changes of the entire language.

DOCUMENTS TO KEEP UPDATED AT ALL TIMES: 

After any change, you should verify and update the following set of documents

1. docs/site - html documentation for the entire system
2. docs/NEX_LANGUAGE_REFERENCE.md - document that describes the Nex language in detail for other AI's
3. README.md - a description for the github page (with links to everything) about how to build, how to use Nex, installations, etc...
4. vscode-extension - the vscode extention, all LSP for language, intellisense, snippets, examples, etc.
