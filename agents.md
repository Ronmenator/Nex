1. Before making any kind of change to the system, first read the architecture.md file in the root of the project, and if the change conflicts with any of the archtictural decisions, then highlight to the user what the difference is and ask the user what to do next.

3. The vscode-extension must always reflect all the latest changes of the entire language.
